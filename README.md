# Restaurant Management System

## Project Description
I have developed a Restaurant Management System using modern technologies and frameworks, designed to provide a robust, secure, and efficient platform for managing restaurant operations. This system supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and integrates user authentication. Key features include order management, table reservations, and seamless user authentication through Spring Security, ensuring a secure and smooth experience for users.

## Features
- ``Secure User Authentication``: Implemented using Spring Security for robust login and registration.
- ``Comprehensive User Management``: Allows seamless login and logout processes.
- ``Versatile CRUD Operations``: Facilitates the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of records effortlessly.
- ``Modern Responsive Design``: Ensures an impeccable user-friendly experience with Thymeleaf templates and Bootstrap for a responsive UI.
- ``Reliable Database Integration``: Utilizes PostgreSQL and JDBC template for effective data management.
  
## Spring Backend

The backend is constructed using Spring MVC and Spring Security, facilitating secure user authentication and robust management of restaurant orders. It employs the JDBC template for efficient database interactions and integrates seamlessly with PostgreSQL for reliable data persistence.

## Technologies
-------------------------
